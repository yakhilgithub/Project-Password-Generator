# Project-Password-Generator

# Day5 of 30 days 30 project challenge

This project is a user-friendly password generator web tool that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily generate strong and secure passwords with various customization options.

HTML:
The HTML file (ps.html) provides the structure and content of the web page. It includes the user interface elements such as buttons, input fields, and labels. The HTML file is responsible for creating the layout and defining the elements that users interact with.

CSS:
The CSS file (ps.css) contains the styling rules for the web page. It defines the visual appearance of the password generator, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. The CSS file ensures that the user interface is visually appealing and easy to use.

JavaScript:
The JavaScript file (ps.js) powers the functionality of the password generator. It handles user input, processes the options selected by the user, and generates the secure passwords. The JavaScript file is responsible for the interactive and dynamic behavior of the web tool.
